# Chess

A simple chess game

## About the Project 
"Let's make a chess game. How hard could it be?", I thought to myself. And then I ended up writing 1000+ lines of code. Chess is hard and there are way too many rules.

## Made with 
- Python 
- Pygame

## Instructions
- Make sure you have python 3.9 or higher installed on your machine 
- Browse to the Chess directory on your terminal/commandline.
- Use ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install the requirements
- Use ```python game.py``` to run the game.
